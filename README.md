# lleTwin
1. Created a digital twin of multistage crosscurrent liquid - liquid extraction using right angle triangle method in MATLAB - A simulation framework using solvers present in MATLAB
2. Also to created a graphical user interface so that various equilibrium data can be entered after choosing crosscurrent LLE
3. Plotted
Extract vs composition for each stage
Percentage removal at each stage
Heat map of concentration for all stages
4. Generated response surface and optimisation of the process
